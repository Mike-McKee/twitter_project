# The Twitter Sherlock Holmes üïµÔ∏è

Here's the deal my friend...

About a month ago, I flexed my `SQL` skills by pulling data from my Twitter account and analyzing it. I ended up writing some complex queries and felt proud. I felt as if I could do anything...

Then I met a lil language called `Python`.

I've realized Python (especially the `Pandas` library) offers more flexibility with data analysis.

So I'm reviving the project and exploring my data with Python.

If you wanna see what I did originally, [visit my website here](https://www.dorkydata.com/projects/does-tweet-length-matter) or check out my [github code here.](https://github.com/Mike-McKee/twitter_project/blob/master/Twitter_Queries.sql)
